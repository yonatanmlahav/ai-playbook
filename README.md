## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture

**TradingView ‚Üí FastAPI ‚Üí Google Sheets ‚Üí AI Learning Loop**

1. **TradingView Indicator (Pine v5)**  
   Detects high-probability breakouts based on:
   - RSI 55‚Äì65 rising  
   - MACD > 0 and > signal  
   - Breakout > recent high  
   - Volume spike vs 20-SMA  
   - Optional gap and price filters  

2. **Webhook API (FastAPI + Railway)**  
   Receives alerts, enriches with live Yahoo Finance data, computes an `A_Score (0‚Äì100)` and ranks each signal (A/B/C).  
   Writes the data into Google Sheets (`Today_Watchlist` and `Alerts_Log`).

3. **Google Sheets Dashboard**  
   Displays real-time ranked tickers, market context, and historical performance for training.

4. **Learning Loop (XGBoost)**  
   Uses labeled trade outcomes (Win/Loss, R-multiple) to retrain weights weekly and improve precision.
